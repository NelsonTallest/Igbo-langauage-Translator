Install the Express Generator by running the following from a terminal:
npm install -g express-generator

The -g switch installs the Express Generator globally on your machine so you can run it from anywhere.
We can now scaffold a new Express application called myExpressApp by running:

express myExpressApp --view pug

This creates a new folder called myExpressApp with the contents of your application. The --view pug parameters tell the generator to use the pug template engine.

To install all of the application's dependencies (again shipped as npm modules), go to the new folder and execute npm install:

cd myExpressApp
npm install
